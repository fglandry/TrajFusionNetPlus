# TrajFusionNet+

This repository contains the code for the paper **TrajFusionNet+: Transformer-Based Prediction of Pedestrian Crossing Intention via Fusion of Trajectory Representations and Scene Graphs**

TrajFusionNetPlus is a transformer-based model for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The architecture builds upon the TrajFusionNet model and combines sequential and visual representations of pedestrian trajectory with a graph-based representation of the scene context.

- TrajFusionNetPlus is composed of three branches:

  - Sequence Attention Module (SAM)
    - Processes a sequential representation of past and predicted pedestrian trajectories.

  - Visual Attention Module (VAM)
    - Utilizes a visual representation of pedestrian trajectories by overlaying observed and predicted bounding boxes onto scene images.

  - Graph Attention Module (GAM)
    - Extracts pedestrian-centric graphs from segmented scene images.
    - Captures non-Euclidean spatial relationships between traffic elements.

## Set up

Start by creating a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n trajfusionnet-env python=3.10 pytorch torchvision pytorchvideo pytorch-cuda accelerate tensorflow -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge
```

The pytorch-cuda version might need to be specified depending on your NVIDIA driver version.

Then, install the remaining libraries with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Downloading the datasets

The PIE and JAAD datasets need to be downloaded and processed by following instructions provided in the following GitHub repos: [https://github.com/aras62/PIE](https://github.com/aras62/PIE) and [https://github.com/ykotseruba/JAAD](https://github.com/ykotseruba/JAAD)

After downloading the datasets, export environment variables pointing to the datasets' locations:
```bash
export JAAD_PATH=<jaad_dataset_location>
export PIE_PATH=<pie_dataset_location>
```

## Inference

To run model inference, first download the model weights from Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mXQL5W0LoYa5vZOI_SFIkFkSuyaL0ux8

Extract the zip file to the data/ directory by running:
```bash
unzip <download_location>/weights.zip -d data/
```

To perform model inference, execute the following command:
```bash
python3 train_test.py -c config_files/TrajFusionNetPlusInference.yaml --test_only
```

The dataset to use and other config parameters can be modified in `config_files/TrajFusionNet.yaml`

## Training

To train the model, run:
```bash
python3 train_test.py -c config_files/TrajFusionNetPlus.yaml --train_end_to_end
```
